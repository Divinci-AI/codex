# Codex-AutoGen-Claude Integration Architecture Overview

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the architecture for integrating Codex CLI with Microsoft AutoGen and Claude Computer Use to create a sophisticated multi-agent system. The integration leverages Codex's existing lifecycle hooks system to trigger AutoGen workflows that can orchestrate Claude Computer Use for automated code review, testing, and validation.

### Core Principles

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Leverages Codex lifecycle hooks for seamless integration
2. **Agent Autonomy**: Each agent operates independently with clear responsibilities
3. **Computer Use Integration**: Claude can interact with the desktop environment for comprehensive validation
4. **Fail-Safe Design**: System continues to function even if integration components fail
5. **Extensible Framework**: Easy to add new agents and capabilities

## Agent Responsibilities

### 1. Codex CLI Agent (Primary)

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Execute user-requested coding tasks
  - Generate and apply code patches
  - Run commands and manage file operations

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Receive Codex lifecycle events via hooks
  - Analyze task context and determine review requirements
  - Orchestrate multi-agent workflows
  - Coordinate between different specialist agents
  - Aggregate results and provide feedback to Codex
  - Manage escalation and error handling

### 3. AutoGen Code Reviewer Agent (Specialist)
- **Role**: Code quality and best practices validation
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Review generated code for quality, security, and best practices
  - Check adherence to coding standards and conventions
  - Identify potential bugs and performance issues
  - Suggest improvements and optimizations
  - Validate documentation and comments

### 4. AutoGen Test Runner Agent (Specialist)
- **Role**: Testing and validation automation
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Execute existing test suites
  - Generate and run new tests for new code
  - Validate functionality and edge cases
  - Check test coverage and quality

  - Run applications and test user interfaces
  - Perform browser-based testing
  - Execute complex validation workflows
  - Capture screenshots and evidence
  - Interact with development tools

## Integration Points

### 1. Lifecycle Hook Integration

Codex lifecycle hooks trigger AutoGen workflows at key points:

```yaml
# Codex configuration
lifecycleHooks:
  enabled: true
  hooks:
    onTaskStart:
      script: "./hooks/autogen-task-start.sh"
      async: true
    onTaskComplete:
      script: "./hooks/autogen-review.sh"
      async: false
      filter:
        customExpression: "eventData.success === true"
    onPatchApply:
      script: "./hooks/autogen-code-review.sh"
      async: true
      filter:
        fileExtensions: ["ts", "js", "py", "java", "go"]
    onCommandComplete:
      script: "./hooks/autogen-test-validation.sh"
      filter:
        commands: ["npm test", "pytest", "go test"]
        exitCodes: [0]
```

### 2. Communication Protocols

#### HTTP API Communication
- **Codex → AutoGen**: RESTful API calls via lifecycle hooks
- **AutoGen → Claude**: Computer Use API integration
- **AutoGen → Codex**: Webhook callbacks for results

#### Event Data Format
```json
{
  "eventType": "task_complete",
  "sessionId": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "context": {
    "task": "Implement user authentication",
    "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet",
    "workingDirectory": "/path/to/project",
    "files": ["src/auth.ts", "tests/auth.test.ts"],
    "success": true,
    "duration": 45000
  },
  "metadata": {
    "linesAdded": 150,
    "linesDeleted": 5,
    "testsAdded": 8,
    "complexity": "medium"
  }
}
```
