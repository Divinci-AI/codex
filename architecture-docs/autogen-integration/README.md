# Codex-AutoGen-Claude Integration Architecture

This directory contains the architecture documentation for integrating Codex CLI with Microsoft AutoGen and Claude Computer Use to create a sophisticated multi-agent system for code review and validation.

## Documents

- [Architecture Overview](./architecture-overview.md) - High-level system design
- [Integration Specification](./integration-spec.md) - Technical implementation details
- [Event Flow Diagram](./event-flow.md) - Detailed event and data flow
- [API Specification](./api-spec.md) - Interface definitions
- [Security Considerations](./security.md) - Security and access control
- [Implementation Plan](./implementation-plan.md) - Development roadmap
- [Configuration Examples](./config-examples.md) - Sample configurations

## Quick Overview

The integration creates a three-tier agent system:

1. **Codex CLI** - Primary code generation and task execution
2. **AutoGen Manager** - Orchestration and workflow management  
3. **Claude Computer Use** - Code review and validation with computer interaction

This enables automated code review, testing validation, and quality assurance workflows.
