# Codex Lifecycle Hooks Implementation TODO

## Overview

Implementation of a comprehensive lifecycle hooks system for Codex that allows external scripts, webhooks, and integrations to be triggered at specific points in the Codex execution lifecycle.

## Architecture Goals

- Event-driven hook system integrated with existing Codex event architecture
- Support for multiple hook types: scripts, webhooks, MCP tools, custom executables

## Implementation Notes

### Security Considerations

- All hook execution must respect existing sandbox policies
- Hook scripts should be validated for permissions and safety
- Timeout management to prevent hanging hooks
- Error isolation to prevent hook failures from crashing Codex
- Secure handling of sensitive data in hook contexts

### Performance Considerations

- Hooks should execute asynchronously to avoid blocking main execution
- Configurable execution modes (parallel vs sequential)
- Resource limits and monitoring for hook execution
- Efficient event routing and filtering

### Compatibility Considerations

- Maintain backward compatibility with existing Codex functionality
- Graceful degradation when hooks are disabled or fail
- Clear migration path for existing notification configurations
- Integration with existing MCP and configuration systems

## Getting Started

To begin implementation, start with **Phase 1.1: Hook Type Definitions and Core Types**. This will establish the foundational types and structures that all other components will build upon.
