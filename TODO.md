## Implementation Notes

### Security Considerations

- All hook execution must respect existing sandbox policies
- Hook scripts should be validated for permissions and safety
- Timeout management to prevent hanging hooks
- Error isolation to prevent hook failures from crashing Codex
- Secure handling of sensitive data in hook contexts

### Performance Considerations

- Hooks should execute asynchronously to avoid blocking main execution
- Configurable execution modes (parallel vs sequential)
- Resource limits and monitoring for hook execution
- Efficient event routing and filtering

### Compatibility Considerations

- Maintain backward compatibility with existing Codex functionality
- Graceful degradation when hooks are disabled or fail
- Clear migration path for existing notification configurations
- Integration with existing MCP and configuration systems
