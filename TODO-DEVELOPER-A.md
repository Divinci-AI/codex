# üîµ Developer A: Core Execution Engine (Backend Focus)

## Your Mission

Implement the core hook execution engine, integrate with Codex's event system, and build comprehensive testing infrastructure.

## üéØ Your Responsibilities

- Hook execution coordination and management
- Event system integration with existing Codex architecture
- Core testing infrastructure and validation
- Performance optimization and error handling

## üìÅ Your Primary Files

- `codex-rs/core/src/hooks/manager.rs` ‚≠ê **Your main file**
- `codex-rs/core/src/hooks/executor.rs` ‚≠ê **Your main file**
- `codex-rs/core/src/hooks/executors/` (new directory) ‚≠ê **Create this**
- `codex-rs/core/src/protocol.rs`
- `codex-rs/core/src/codex.rs`
- `codex-rs/core/src/agent.rs`
- `codex-rs/exec/src/event_processor.rs`

## üöÄ Start Here: Phase 2.1 - Core Hook Manager

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY: Complete Hook Manager Implementation

**File**: `codex-rs/core/src/hooks/manager.rs`

#### Current Status

The file exists with basic structure but needs complete implementation.

#### Your Tasks

- [ ] **Hook Execution Coordination**

  - Implement the `trigger_event` method to actually execute hooks
  - Add hook filtering based on event type and conditions
  - Coordinate execution of multiple hooks for the same event

- [ ] **Event Subscription and Routing**

  - Create event subscription mechanism
  - Route events to appropriate hooks based on registry
  - Handle event filtering and matching

- [ ] **Error Handling and Logging**

  - Implement comprehensive error handling for hook failures
  - Add structured logging for hook execution
  - Handle partial failures gracefully

- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**
  - Add execution time tracking
  - Implement hook execution metrics
  - Monitor resource usage

#### Implementation Guide

```rust
// In manager.rs - implement this method
impl HookManager {
    pub async fn trigger_event(&self, event: LifecycleEvent) -> Result<(), HookError> {
        if !self.config.hooks.enabled {
            return Ok(());
        }

        // 1. Get matching hooks from registry
        let context = HookContext::new(event.clone(), /* working_dir */);
        let hooks = self.registry.get_matching_hooks(&event, &context)?;

        // 2. Execute hooks based on priority and mode
        // 3. Handle errors and collect results
        // 4. Log execution metrics

        // TODO: Your implementation here
    }
}
```

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**: Begin with basic hook execution in `manager.rs`
2. **Test Early**: Write tests as you implement features
3. **Use Existing Patterns**: Follow Codex's existing async patterns
4. **Performance First**: Keep the async, non-blocking design
5. **Error Handling**: Hooks should never crash the main process
6. **Logging**: Add comprehensive tracing for debugging

**You've got this! üöÄ**
